# SimpleCameraApp
This is old-fashion style camera app. What I want to tell you here is that this app has only 3 functions. It enables you taking a photo, picking up photos out of your iphone photo album and sharing photos online like Twitter, Line, Instagram etc.
There is only one viewcontroller here. And it had big imageView occupies half of the screen and 3 buttons assigned to do functions to open album, open camera, open the bar where you choose the platform to share on.
Once you pick up or take the photo through album or camera, the photo chosen/taken will appear on the imageView and you will be able to share it by simply hitting share button.
